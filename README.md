# Create an incident management application using React, Express and MongoDB

This application is a sample applicatoion for incident management. Admin should be able to CRUD the incidents and assign them to user, then use can acknowledge it and resolve it after fix it. Currently the user login and access management has been implemented in the backend, but the front end don't have time to implement. I will implement this later when get time. Now you can manage the incidents and resolve it in different page without login.
